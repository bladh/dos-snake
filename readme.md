# DOS Snake

Title explains it all.

## Build

You'll need to clone [allegro-4.2.2-xc](https://github.com/msikma/allegro-4.2.2-xc)
into the `vendor` directory, and build it with [andrewwutw's DJGPP build](https://github.com/andrewwutw/build-djgpp).
After that, you can run `make` from the base directory. The resulting `dist/main.exe`
can be run with DOSBox.
